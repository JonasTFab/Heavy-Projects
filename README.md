Project 1 in computational physics

The file named project_1b.py is a python filed which inlcude the algorithm for numerically solving the general form of the tridiagonal matrix.

project_1c.py is like the previous file but now in a spesified form. It satisfies a tridiagonal matrix which is on the Töplitz form. It contains less flops for each iteration which leads to faster computing.

project_1d.py is where we compute the relative error for different step length h using the special conditions as in 1c.

And finally the last python file project_1e.py is where we compare our logarithm with the brute force algorithm from Morten's library. This algorithm uses LU-decomposition to solve the equation Ax=b.

computationalLib.py is the python library made by Morten Hjorth-Jensen. This is the location of the LU-decomposition we're using in project_1e.py.

This repository also contains some other minor files which is not necessarily important to project 1.
