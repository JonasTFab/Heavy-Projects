Project 1 in computational physics

The file named Project_1b.py is a python filed which inlcude the algorithm for numerically solving the general form of the tridiagonal matrix.

Project_1c.py is like the previous file but now in a spesified form. It satisfies a tridiagonal matrix which is on the TÃ¶plitz form. It contains less flops for each iteration which leads to faster computing.
